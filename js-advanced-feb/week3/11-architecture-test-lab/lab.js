// Isolation of concerns with the help of Modules:

// Backend API
// API Request logic
// Data Manipulation
// UI display and control
// Utility functions

// loose coupling - every module has to be connected to others, but not to be too dependend on each other. Ex you can change the ram of computer with another ram. When connections are loose, the components can be exchanged and reused. we can change one module without affecting the rest

//strong cohesion - the parts of one domain/ module are strongly connected between each other
